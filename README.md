Based on the temperatures that were gathered in June it goes without saying that these average temperatures would allow them have the at least a fairly good possibility of being successful with the surfing portion of the business.  On the other hand, the data gathered for December leaves some questions as to being successful with an ice cream shop. With the average temperatures for December being in the low 70's it seems that they would be able to make it with ice cream shop as well because the temperature's on average don't drop below 70.
